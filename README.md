## Project Objectives

The goal of the app is to create a method to examine a Social Network with the provided dataset, ie. mockup database, which represents a group of people and their relations.

Each person listed has one or more connections to the group. The app should provide functionality to choose a person from the database and display the following information about this person:
 	• Direct friends: those people who are directly connected to the chosen user
	• Friends of friends: those who are one step away from the chosen user but not directly connected to the chosen user
	• Suggested friends: people in the group who know 2 or more direct friends of the chosen user but are not directly connected to the chosen user
